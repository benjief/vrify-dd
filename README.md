Methodologies and Justifications:
To handle and analyze the geophysical data for this project, I developed a series of Python scripts that organized, cleaned, and processed multiple datasets (including shapefiles, TIFFs, GDBs, XYZ files, and CSVs). The key methodology involved converting data to CSVs or GeoTIFFs for easier manipulation, normalizing Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) to EPSG:4326 for consistency, and generating visualizations to identify patterns and anomalies. The decision to standardize on EPSG:4326 was made to streamline comparison between datasets in QGIS, and the use of CSV and heatmaps allowed for more accessible data manipulation and analysis.

For clustering and anomaly detection, I opted to use K-Means due to its simplicity and ease of implementation, alongside DBSCAN and HDBSCAN for more flexible anomaly detection. These methods allowed me to detect clusters in residual magnetic field data and radiometric values, which are useful indicators in mineral exploration.

Key Findings and Insights:
The most interesting finding from this analysis was the identification of positive residual magnetic field anomalies close to known precious metal markers. This suggests a potential link between these anomalies and hydrothermal systems, which are commonly associated with porphyry copper deposits. Additionally, clustering analysis revealed consistent patterns in other lines, with potential faulting identified in the northwest region.

Radiometric data also showed elevated values in areas of interest, potentially supporting the hypothesis of hydrothermal activity. While the Bouguer gravity data did not yield significant insights, it is possible that subtle anomalies still play a role in the region’s geological story.

Challenges Encountered:
Although I hold a geophysics degree, my experience has been limited to soft rock interpretation (e.g., seismic and microseismic data). Transitioning to magnetic, gravitational, and radiometric data for hard rock exploration was intimidating. I felt overwhelmed by the unfamiliar datasets, but through perseverance, I started to gain just a little bit of confidence. Visualizing the data in ways that made sense to me was rewarding, though still challenging. In retrospect, my interpretations may not match those of more experienced professionals, but the process was an invaluable learning experience.

Potential Implications for Geophysical Exploration in Nevada:
The clustering and anomaly detection methods applied here highlight areas that might be worth further investigation, especially in regions where positive residual magnetic anomalies and elevated radiometric values converge. These findings suggest the possibility of further hydrothermal alteration and potential mineralization in the study area. Continued exploration, including detailed geophysical surveys, could help confirm or refute these hypotheses.

Suggestions for Future Work or Improvements:
There is ample opportunity to refine and expand this project. The code I wrote could be significantly cleaned up and made more efficient (I've run out of time and my brain has stopped working). Additionally, with more time and guidance, I could improve my interpretation skills and dig deeper into the geophysical data. Future work might also explore alternative clustering algorithms and deeper integration of different geophysical parameters to build a more robust understanding of the region’s geology.
